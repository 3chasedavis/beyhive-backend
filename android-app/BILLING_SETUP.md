# Android Billing Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to properly configure Google Play Billing for the Beyhive Alert Android app.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Product ID Consistency ✅
- **Problem**: Android used `com.chasedavis.beyhivealert.notifications` while iOS used `com.chasedavis.beyhivealert.notificationssss`
- **Solution**: Updated Android to use the same product ID as iOS: `com.chasedavis.beyhivealert.notificationssss`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
- **Problem**: Limited error feedback and no retry mechanism
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with specific messages for different billing errors and retry functionality

### 3. Improved User Experience ✅
- **Problem**: Users couldn't retry failed purchases or dismiss errors
- **Solution**: Added retry and dismiss buttons in the paywall UI

## Google Play Console Setup

### Step 1: Create In-App Product
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your app: "Beyhive Alert"
3. Navigate to **Monetize** → **Products** → **In-app products**
4. Click **Create product**
5. Fill in the details:
   - **Product ID**: `com.chasedavis.beyhivealert.notificationssss`
   - **Name**: "Beyhive Notifications"
   - **Description**: "Unlock real-time tour notifications"
   - **Price**: $1.99 (or your preferred price)
   - **Status**: Active

### Step 2: Test the Product
1. Go to **Testing** → **License testing**
2. Add test accounts (Gmail addresses)
3. Upload a signed APK to **Internal testing** track
4. Test purchases with test accounts

### Step 3: Verify Billing Permissions
The app already has the required permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```

## Testing Billing

### Development Testing
1. **Use Test Accounts**: Add your Gmail account to license testing
2. **Test Purchases**: Use test credit cards provided by Google
3. **Check Logs**: Monitor console logs for billing events

### Common Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Purchase**: Complete purchase flow
2. **User Cancellation**: Cancel during purchase
3. **Network Issues**: Test with poor connectivity
4. **Already Owned**: Test purchasing already owned item
5. **Product Unavailable**: Test with inactive product

## Billing Flow

### Purchase Process
1. User taps "Unlock for $1.99"
2. App queries product details from Google Play
3. Google Play billing dialog appears
4. User completes purchase
5. App acknowledges purchase
6. Purchase status saved locally
7. User gains access to notifications

### Error Handling
The app now handles these billing errors:
- `USER_CANCELED`: User cancelled purchase
- `ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED`: User already owns the item
- `ITEM_UNAVAILABLE`: Product not available
- `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE`: Google Play Services issue
- `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`: Network connectivity issue
- `DEVELOPER_ERROR`: Configuration error
- `ERROR`: General error

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Product not found"**
   - Verify product ID matches exactly in Google Play Console
   - Ensure product is active
   - Check app is signed with release key

2. **"Billing unavailable"**
   - Update Google Play Services on device
   - Check device has Google Play Store installed
   - Verify app is installed from Google Play (not sideloaded)

3. **"Purchase failed"**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify Google Play Console configuration
   - Check app logs for specific error codes

### Debug Logs
The app logs all billing events. Look for:
```
BillingManager: Billing setup finished - Response: X, Message: Y
BillingManager: Product details found - Name, Price: $X.XX
BillingManager: Purchase acknowledged successfully
```
