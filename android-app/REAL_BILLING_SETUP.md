signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        storeFile = file("keystore.jks")
        storePassword = "beyhive2024"
        keyAlias = "beyhive-key"
        keyPassword = "beyhive2024"
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Build Release APK

```

4. Fill in release notes
5. Click **Review release**

### 3.2 Test with Internal Testing

```
