# Local Storage Solution (100% FREE - No External Services)

## Why Local Storage?
- ✅ **Completely FREE** (no payment info required)
- ✅ **No external services** (no Firebase, Cloudinary, etc.)
- ✅ **No API keys needed**
- ✅ **Works immediately**
- ✅ **No setup required**

## How It Works
Images are stored as base64 data directly in your JSON files. This means:
- Images are embedded in your `outfits.json` and `partners.json` files
- No external hosting needed
- Works with your existing iOS app
- Completely free forever

## Benefits
- ✅ **$0/month** (vs $89/month Cloudinary)
- ✅ **No credit card required**
- ✅ **No API setup needed**
- ✅ **Works immediately**
- ✅ **No external dependencies**

## Setup
**No setup required!** The code is already configured to use local storage.

## How to Use
1. **Upload images** through your admin panel
2. **Images are automatically** stored as base64 in JSON files
3. **Your iOS app** will display them normally
4. **No changes needed** to your app

## File Sizes
- Base64 images are about 33% larger than the original
- For outfit images (usually 100KB-500KB), this is manageable
- JSON files will be larger but still very reasonable

## Migration
- Existing Cloudinary images will continue to work
- New uploads will be stored locally
- No changes needed in your iOS app

## Ready to Use!
Your app is now configured to use local storage. Just deploy and it will work!
